title: How to get 2 parties to talk

This week I was part of modelling session run by our consultant. In this meeting we had representatives from client
(content authors), the tech lead (myself), our BA and QA.
The idea was to start to model parts of the webapp into the cms.

We started by talking the design of the footer and add it into a online tool that allows adding sticky notes (miro).

The consultant then started to ask us all what areas we can identify on the design, the names we can give them.

In the past we had really hard time getting much from the client, this session became a game changer.
The content authors, the BA and everybody else contributed. We managed to identify areas that needed to be mapped in such a
way that captured the business needs.

Really exited to collaborate in this way, on the next pieces of the puzzle.

Special thanks to our consult!
